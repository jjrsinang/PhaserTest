    <h3>Context</h3>
    <p>Bee population is slowly declining around the world. This is a problem because bees are major agents of pollination, making them
        essential for our food production. This game helps raise awareness of this situation by means of entertainment. The game objective
        is to keep the bee alive - similar to what we should be aiming to do. I recommend watching the video below by kurzgesagt.
